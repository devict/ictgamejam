## What's a game Jam?

We build video games in a weekend. Developers join teams or work alone to create a video game based around a common theme.

### *Do I need to have made a game before?* 

Plenty of previous participants had little or no game development experience, but they had a blast. Weâ€™ll have lots of people willing to answer questions and help you learn at your own pace!

### *Do I need to be a programmer?* 

No! Games also need artists, writers, and designers. There is no rule for whether your game must be 2D, 3D, complex, or even have graphics. Make a board or card game if you like!

### *Do I need a computer?*

Yes! You need to bring your own computer capable of connecting to Wi-Fi. Desktops are fine, we'll lock the room up overnight.

### *I love it! I must know more!*

If you insist! Participating gets you snacks and drinks, all while hanging out with local game developers! Meals are provided throughout the weekend.
